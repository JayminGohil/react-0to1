Welcome to my React Projects repository! This is my personal learning journey where I go from knowing little or nothing about React to building full-fledged apps. The goal of this repository is to document and share my progress step by stepâ€”from the very basics to more advanced concepts.

# Projects List: 0 to 1

## [1. Chef Claude](./chef_claude/)
AI Chef â€“ A react application that allows users to input a list of ingredients, which is then sent as an API request to an AI model (Mistralai From Hugging Face here) to generate a simple recipe based on the provided ingredients.

## [2. Tenzies](./tenzies/)
Tenzies â€“ A simple dice game built with React where players roll dice     until all show the same number, with the option to hold individual dice to lock their values.

## [3. Assembly: Endgame](./assembly_endgame/)
Assembly: Endgame is a twist on Hangman where each wrong guess kills off a beloved programming languageâ€”eight flops and Assembly is the last one standing!

## [4. Tic Tac Toe](./tic_tac_toe/)
A simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React, allowing two players to take turns marking X or O on a 3x3 grid. The game detects the winner or a draw and allows for a new game reset.

## [3. Memory Flash](./memory_flash/)
A fast-paced memory challenge game where 5 random letters or numbers flash briefly on the screen, and the player must recall and type them correctly.
